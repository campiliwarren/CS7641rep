CS 7641 Homework 1 - Supervised Learning

This program uses two datafiles:
	1- letter-recognition.csv (17 attributes, 20,000 rows)
	2- Student-Performance-math.csv (22 attributes, 396 rows)

## Software information:
Anaconda Navigator, Python 3.6, Spyder 3.3.1 

Python modules used include:
datetime
numpy
pandas
graphviz
matplotlib
sklearn

### To Run Code ###

Within Spyder, run HW1.py
BE AWARE that these programs can take a long time to execute.

### Folder ##
There is one folder named macw3 which includes:

letter-recognition.csv          --> datafile
Student-Performance-math.csv    --> datafile
HW1.py   						--> main file
DecisionTreeBoosting.Python     --> Decision Tree and Boosting algorithms, it creates 4 .pdf files in the working directory
										LETTERS-REC-gini-DEPTH-8.gv.pdf: tree depth 8
										LETTERS-REC-gini-DEPTH-9.gv.pdf: tree depth 9
										LETTERS-REC-gini-DEPTH-10.gv.pdf: tree depth 10
